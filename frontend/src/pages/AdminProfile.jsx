                                I am a retired Army combat medic. I served two tours in Iraqâ€”the second of which was cut short because of a brain injury.
                                I have a large extended family, and see my Mom pretty much every week (yeh, I'm kind of a mamma's boy).
                                I grew up in Pinellas County, Florida (the St. Petersburg-Clearwater beaches) and now live a little further south in
                                Sarasota.

                                One of the things I still enjoy is movies. I've watched a bunch of them. This site is where
                                I share my favorites, highlighting the stories and the actors I enjoy the most. I've been
                                told I sometimes have unusual taste in movies and I do tend to watch my favorites
                                multiple times. (C'mon, you can't get too much of a monkey driving a car in Grandma's
                                Boy!)
